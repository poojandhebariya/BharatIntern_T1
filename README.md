# User Registration System with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB

Welcome to my repository! ðŸš€ 

In this assignment, I've crafted a robust user registration system using MongoDB as the database, Express.js for the server, and Node.js as the runtime with JWT for user authentication. Below, you'll find essential details about the technologies used, key features, achievements, instructions to get started, and more.

## Technologies Utilized
- **MongoDB:** A powerful NoSQL database for secure storage of user information.
- **Express.js:** A versatile web application framework that facilitates server-side development.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that enables efficient server-side execution.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure authentication by generating and validating tokens.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Form:** An intuitive registration form featuring fields for username, email, and password.
- **Secure Storage:** User data is stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring confidentiality.
- **Seamless Communication:** Express.js ensures smooth communication between the front-end and back-end components.
- **Registration Handling:** Backend logic processes registration requests and provides informative feedback messages.

## Achievements
- **Server-Side Validation:** Implemented robust server-side validation to enhance data integrity.
- **MongoDB Connection:** Successfully established a connection between the application and MongoDB for seamless data interaction.
- **Deployment:** The application has been deployed on a local server, allowing for thorough testing and verification.

## Getting Started
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Download and set up MongoDB.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Start the application with `npm start`.



Happy coding! ðŸš€
